Usage:

Tabs: when creating a new tab you can name the tab whatever you like but when adding the extension the options are html, css, scss,
javascript and undefined if you want to code in for a example c or ruby or even c++ you just type undefined and whem saving a
undefined tab its automaticly going to try to save it as 'all files' so you manually add the extension and with the
html, css, scss, javascript and python its going to automaticly save it as their file type

also:
when saving please select 'file' then 'save' or 'save as' because the shortcuts Ctrl + s not always work

and: if the undefined tab does not save please instead of undefined type just a '.' and if it still doesnt work then copy your code and paste it into a tab like html and then when saving just choose 
'all files' and delete the .html format and type the format you want
