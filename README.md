Usage:

Tabs: when creating a new tab you can name the tab whatever you like but when adding the extension the options are html, css, scss,
javascript and undefined if you want to code in for a example c or ruby or even c++ you just type 'Undefined' and it will save it as al files
because i have just fixed the bug that it cant save today (12/23/2023)


also:
when saving a file if you click 'save' or 'save as' it doesnt matter which one you clicked
