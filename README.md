Update 1.2:

Tabs: you can now close tabs and saving tabs is fixed but you still cannot close the automaticly created ones this will be fixed in a bug fix in version 1.3 or 1.2.1

File Explorer: file explorer has been removed because it was useless instead it was replaced by a plain text spac for notes

Monitor Compatibility: not all peaople have 16:9 monitors with 1920x1080px so now smIDE is smaller but you still can resize it

System Compatibility: i fixed Linux compatibility

Also: Windows thinks that this program is a virus but dont worry you can look into the script and see that this is not a virus because windows thinks this is malware i think but as i said its not a virus just a project that i made for fun! so FUCK YOU WINDOWS!!!!!1!!!!!111!1111!!1111!1!1 (Also that is why i use Arch Linux (without gnu cuz gnu is bloat))
